# Modeling Market Cap of NYSE Companies
In this project, I model how relationships various
valuations and metrics of companies affect their market cap

## Project Overview
This project is divided into two files.
In ```stock_project.py``` I fetched data from
6716 companies from Yahoo! Finance and placed them
into a ```pandas``` DataFrame.

In the second, I ran a linear regression on the
data to see how the various valuations affected their
Market Cap.
